          <li>CSS is used to stylize and format the HTML content on a webpage</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage with CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>External style sheets are common as it allows saving CSS and HTML codes on different files</li>
          <li>External style sheets are linked to the HTML document using a link function in the HTML code</li>
          <li>A CSS rule is comprised of a selector (which defines the elements affected) and a declaration, containing a property and value to be applied to those elements</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

       <li>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that allows users to ineract with webpages</li>
       <li>JS is linked to your webpage using a script element in the HTML code, much like the link element to apply a CSS Style Sheet</li>
       <li>Script element should be added at the bottom of your HTML code, it may cause issues if it loads before any HTML content that it is supposed to interact with because the web browser reads code in order</li>
       <li>JS and many other programming languages are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning index values begin at 0 and indicies are whole numbers that increase by 1 each time </li>
       <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
       <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
